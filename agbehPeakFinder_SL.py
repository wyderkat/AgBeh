    findPeaks(center,image[,kwargs...])

    Take a saxslab tiff of AgBeh, and return peak spacing, and an array of found peak coordinates (radius from center).

    Peaks in the radial range (firstPeak:lastPeak) are found by first unrolling the image into polar coordinates. We then
    iterate down the image by rows and do a rough peak search on each row. The peak coordinates from this search are then
    fed to a function that separately fits a small range of a row, centered on each peak coordinate, to a gaussian
    curve, and the mean from each fit is added into a histogram. This process is repeated for each row in polar space.

    Also, the spacing between all the peaks in a row is added to a histogram of peak spacings.

    At the end, we have a histogram of peak locations and a histogram of peak spacings. The peak spacing
    histogram is fit to a gaussian, and the mean, sigma, and error are returned.

    Further, the histogram of peak locations is treated similarly to a row in the first step, and it's peaks
    are again fit to gaussians, and the mean, sigma, and error of each are stored in a list of tuples in the output.

     input
     image:         A path to a saxslab tiff, or an np array of a saxslab tiff.
    
     center:        tuple or list -> (rowCenter,colCenter), where rowCenter is the coord in pix of the center row.
                                                   colCenter is defined the same way, but for center col.
     peakThresh:    Parameter used for peak finding. This is the min acceptable ratio of a peak's height to the height
                    of the largest peak, in order to be counted as a peak by the peak finder.

     verbose        Control the level of output from this function. Setting this to false will cause the function to
                    supress any output to the screen. Setting to true will print a small report upon copletion, and also
                    return the histograms of peak locations and spacings.

     doLogIm:       Whether or not to work with the log of the input image.

     pSize:         How many lines in the phi direction will we use in polar space?

     firstPeak:     Min radius of a peak to be considered in the calculations.

     lastPeak:      Max radius of a peak to be considered in the calculations. Set to None go all the way out to edge of
                    image.

     smoothingWindow: How many pixels to use in the smoothing algorithm.

     minDiff:       Min distance of neighboring peaks to consider in the peak spacing calculations.

     difThresh:     Threshold of ave peak distances. If the ave is above this, then we auto-adjust firstPeak=50 in
                    order to avoid false peaks near the beamstop.

     maxNPeaks:     How many peaks out from the center to we use (default is 5).
     
     output
     tuple:        (peakSpacing, peakSpacingSigma, peakSpacingErr, peakSpacingSigmaErr, peaksList, imPolar, im0)
                    
                   peakSpacing, peakSpacingSigma, peakSpacingErr, peakSpacingSigmaErr are from fitting a histogram
                   of found peak spacingss to a gaussian. 

                   peaksList is a list of tuples (peakCenter,sig,errPeakCenter,errSig), as radius from center.
                   imPolar is the polar representation of the input image that is used for the peak finding.
                   im0 is the original image passed in.

                   If verbose was set to true, the output will be:

                   (peakSpacing, peakSpacingSigma, peakSpacingErr, peakSpacingSigmaErr, eaksList, imPolar, im00, peaksHistAr, dPeaksHistAr)

                   With the last two items in the output tuple are the peak location histogram, and the peak spacing
                   histogram as tuples of numpy arrays, where the [0]th element is the data and the [1]st is the axis.

     Returns None on failure.
